        the master spy Lady Raven Nightshade, and the legendary knight Sir Marcus Goldenblade.
        
        To the east lies the Merchant Republic of Goldspire, governed by the Trade Council of Seven, including

        civilizations, magical phenomena, and cosmic threats that challenge the very fabric of reality itself.
        
        The Prime Material Plane centers around the world of Aethermoor, where the Celestial Empire of Draconis 
        spans twelve provinces, each governed by a Council of Nobles: Duke Alderon Dragonheart of Flamereach, 
        Duchess Valeria Stormcrest of Thunderpeak, Count Thaddeus Ironforge of Steelholm, Baroness Lyanna Rosethorne

        rules from his Molten Throne, commanding legions of flame elementals, phoenix riders, and the elite 
        Infernal Guard. His court includes the sorceress Ignia Blazeheart, the smith-god Vulcan Forgemaster, 
        and the warrior princess Ember Dragonscale.

        where Lich Emperor Malachar commands an army of death knights, bone dragons, and spectral legions. 
        His inner circle consists of the vampire lord Dracul Bloodmoon, the banshee queen Morgana Soulrender, 
        the death knight Ser Blackheart, and the lich sorceress Vex'ahlia Deathwhisper.
        
        The Feywild blooms with the Court of Eternal Spring, ruled by Queen Titania Starweaver and King Oberon 
        Moonwhisper, whose subjects include the mischievous pixie lord Puck Glimmerwing, the wise dryad 
        Willow Oaksong, the fierce satyr warrior Pan Stormhoof, and the enigmatic eladrin archfey Autumn Twilight.

        supreme commander Zerthimon Planeslicer, the void captain Gith'tya Starrender, and the psychic warrior 
        Xen'drik Mindbreaker.
