The Enigmatic Door

#### Threat Details

An ancient, massive door of unknown origin stands sealed at the heart of the island's largest temple.

Its surface is etched with arcane symbols, unreadable even to the most learned Felidar.

The growing consensus among the faithful is that the door's purpose is linked to the Star Cats' departure from the physical realm, and that its opening could portend their return—or destruction.
