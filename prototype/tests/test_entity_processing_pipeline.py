    Deep beneath the Crystalline Mountains, the Dread Titan known as Malakar stirs from its millennia-long slumber. He has been dormant since the Great Cataclysm, but now his presence causes earthquakes that shake the very foundations of the world. The ancient fortress of Shadowhold, built atop his resting place, begins to crumble as his power awakens.

    High Priestess Serana of the Temple of Dawn leads the Order of the Dawn in their desperate quest to stop him. She discovered the Prophecy of Binding in the Archives of Light, an ancient tome that speaks of three sacred artifacts needed to contain the titan's power. The first artifact, the Sunblade of Solara, rests in the hands of Sir Marcus Brightshield, a paladin of unquestionable virtue. He guards it in the fortress city of Lumina's Gate.

    The second artifact, the Moonstone of Lunaris, was lost during the Battle of Silver Pass when General Thorne Ironwill's army was defeated by shadow creatures. These creatures, known as Voidspawn, serve Malakar and grow stronger as he awakens. They have established a stronghold in the ruins of Thornkeep, the general's former base of operations.

    In the enchanted forests of Thaloria, the elven Archdruid Sylvanas Moonsong protects the third artifact, the Heart of Nature. She commands a circle of druids who have sensed the growing corruption spreading from the mountains. The corruption turns the very earth black and withers any plant life it touches.

    Meanwhile, in the port city of Suncrest Bay, Captain Isabella Stormsail has been hired by the Order of the Dawn to transport their forces across the treacherous Sea of Serpents. Her ship, the Dawn's Promise, is one of the few vessels blessed by Aqualis herself and capable of navigating the increasingly dangerous waters.
